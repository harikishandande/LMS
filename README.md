# LMS

It's a old school project-<b>Library Management System</b>. I have added certain feature well-suited for my college "Digital Library". 

<h3>About :</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Individual User has to enter into the localhost/LMS/index.php portal.</li>
  <li>Search for books, can use book names, author names, category, tags.</li>
  <li>If the intent book available, in a single click, book will be assigned to your name for a certain period of time.(You can provide your estimated time as well)</li>
  <li>When the intent book is not available you can check when it can be available, also you can assign your name under waiting list.</li>
  <li>When the time runs-out still if you want to keep the book, you can extend it from your mob app itself if the extending period comes under your estimated time before or else revisit the library is required.</li>
  <li>If the waiting list is more than the threshold value, extending the time period may cost you some bucks.</li>
  <li>Delay in returning book, lost/damaged cases will come under penalty charges.</li>
</ul>
